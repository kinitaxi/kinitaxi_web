                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">What Downloading Acxi App Means</span><br><br>
                                        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. We are offering you this app to use for your own personal use without cost, but you should be aware that you cannot modify the app or any part of it, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also should not try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Axci
                                        <br><br>
                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Making Changes Going Forward</span><br><br>
                                        Axci is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

                                        <br><br>The Axci app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us so that you can book rides. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Axci app won’t work properly or at all.

                                        <br><br>You should be aware that there are certain things that Axci will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app, such as the ability to book your rides and the Mobile Host function will all require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Axci cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

                                        <br><br>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <span class="font-weight-bold">Updates and Upgrades</span><br><br>
                                        At some point we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android the requirements for the operating systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Axci does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
